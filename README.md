# Mathieu-Functions
Matlab library for circumenferential and radial Matheiu functions
In physical models we try to look for symmetries that may simplify the initial problem and allow us to proceed in our investigation. If we consider the Helmotz equation in an elliptical framework through the separation of variables we obtain two different differential equations whose solutions are the standard Mathieu functions and the modified Mathieu functions.
Thus, the study of these special functions becomes relevant and the lack of a built-in implementation in both Mathematica and Matlab software increases the need for a correct computational scheme.Therefor, the aim of this thesis is to deeper investigate a computational scheme for these special functions and to highlight the difficulties encountered and the proposed solutions.
